    A little bit about us!       
    Hi, our names are Arushi, Ananya, Priya, and Sumedha. 
    We are 15 and 16 years old and currently 
    a sophmores/juniors at Del Norte High School in 
    San Diego, California. We are 
    Asian-American females with a desire to help others
    struggling with their mental health. 
    Here is our website!
                 
    Throughout this trimester, 
    we displayed some concepts we have learned 
    on this blog through the integration of 
    HTML, CSS, SASS, Python, and Javascript. 
    Hope you enjoy!
